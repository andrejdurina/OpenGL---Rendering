# Basic OpenGL visualization
This repository contains code to basic primitives rendering via OpenGL.

Most of this "application" is written in C++. But also includes some basics of GLSL & C languages.
To run it this app , check it's makefile.

I've inspired myself by https://github.com/TheCherno tutorials and code examples.
